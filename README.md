## **ExtraLogic** - Simplifying Gameplay Logic for Unreal Engine

ExtraLogic is a versatile Unreal Engine plugin designed to simplify the development of complex gameplay mechanics without writing repetitive or specific code. With its simple Logic Objects and Blueprint Library, ExtraLogic allows you to create flexible and reusable conditions for various gameplay systems.

### Key Features:

ðŸ§© Condition Objects: Easily implement logic with simple boolean outputs. These condition objects are perfect for creating decorators or managing gameplay flow, eliminating the need for writing custom code for each scenario.

ðŸ§© Blackboard Value Provider Objects: A set of lightweight helper objects that set predefined values on blackboard keys by type. One for each Blackboard Key Type, all based on mutual parent class.

ðŸ§© Future Enhancements: In future updates, ExtraLogic will include triggerable world events and a comprehensive Blueprint function library that exposes handy functions and C++-only features, further expanding the toolâ€™s utility.
